# cxc_gamertag

he Gamertag Script displays certain character information and currently only works with QB Core. If you need it for another framework, Iâ€™ll need someone with an ESX or QBX server for testing.

It uses the GTA V API Gamertag System [Docs](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/gamer-tags/) to display names above players' heads.
